    "# BIG IDEAS FINAL PROJECT\n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "We chose to use the overarching metric of fire safety to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We chose this because we believe that a safe neighborhood is a good one. Our 3 submetrics were number of fire incidents, number of water features, and acreage of green space. These were not our initial metrics, but when trying to use other datasets, we came across a few problems and found it beneficial to switch to datasets that better suited our knowledge level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our 3 submetrics use 1 dataset each, those being a dataset of all fire incidents in the city, a dataset of the acreage of greenspace in the city, and a dataset with info about the number of water features in the city.\n",

    "# Best Neighborhood:\n",
    "We decided that the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Regent Square. We came to this comclusion because it ranks #1 in greenspace acreage, #2 in number of fire incidents, and is just out of top 20(tied for 7th if including ties) for water features. We mainly picked this because of its high ranking in greenspace and fire incidents, escpecially because we veiw those submetrics as more impactful than the number of water features, because that dataset includes some water features that aren't especially helpful in a fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",

    "## Thomas' Conclusion\n",
    "My favorite neighborhood here is Squirrel Hill because of how it reminds me of a town near my house. I find it very interesting how even though its my favorite it is far from being the \"best\" according to our metric. Meanwhile, we found that Regent Square is the \"best\" but it contains pretty much just compact houseing which is a much more boring neighborhood.\n",

    "## Max's Conclusion\n",
    "My favorite neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Squirrel Hill because it's where my Mom grew up. It's a place that I've been shown everytime I've been in pittsburgh. While it does have the most water features by far, its other metrics don't hold up so well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Allen's Conclusion\n",
    "My favorite nieghborhood in Pittsburgh is Central Oakland because I like the attractions and the greenery. Though it doesnt rank high in any of metrics for fire safety I still like the area and all the things to do in it. Though my favorite is Central Oakland, we found the Regenet Square is the safest from fires across out datasets, but its not a very exciting area and has little public attrations.\n"
